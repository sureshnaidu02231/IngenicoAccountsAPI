1) I have used SpringBoot to create a REST API.It has two end points.one is to create Accounts and the other is to transfer money 
   from one account to another account.
2) I have kept business validations of Account should not overdrawn and to handle Simultaneous requests.I will throw 
   a Runtime Exception if the transfer amount is greater than balance.I have handled simultaneous requests with lastupdate.
   If i get a request which is having the latest data in db then it allows that request otherwise it will throw an Invalid request

3) I have used hsql file based database and the properties are mentioned in application.properties.
4) I have used postman to test the two end points.
5) start the Application with the Application.java as Run as Java Application.once u start the application is available 
   on default port 8080.
6) To verify the data in hsql db , we can open the hsql jar pointing to the file.  
 


Create Account:

url :http://localhost:8080/Account/

Interface :

{
    "customer": {
        "name": "suresh",
        "mobileNumber": "7093704574",
        "email": "sureshnaidu0223@gmail.com",
        "addresses": [
            {
                "postalCode": "1185PA",
                "houseNo": "308",
                "city": "Amstelveen",
                "country": "NetherLands"
            }
        ],
        "accounts": [
            {
                "accountName": "Suresh Naidu",
                "accountType": "Savings",
                "accountNumber": "NL42INGB12345678",
                "balance": "10"
            }
        ]
    }
}

Transfer Money :

url : http://localhost:8080/Account/transfer

Interface :

{
   "fromCustomerId": "100",
   "fromAccountNumber": "NL42INGB12345678",
   "toCustomerId":"101",
   "toAccountNumber":"NL42INGB12345678",
   "amount": "9",
   "fromAccountLastUpdateDate":"2017-10-08 11:21:08.909000"
}

Once the Accounts are created in step1 , we can take the fromAccountLastUpdateDate from the database file (C://rad//onePAM/testdb.txt)
